How to come out of your shell?

"come out of your Shell!" that is a common phrase ..But how to ? What are those shells? Being a girl brought up in India ,those shells are so carfully designed by me,parents,teachers,friends,common sense &  media(ofcourse..) 

Once parents put the foundation block of that shell,we start building on top that ..wonderfully carved,sensor eyes attached all around,nice strong shells. It works always ..when you sleep in an unsafe place or travel, you just need to put it in high alert mode..rest it will take care,right?

yes,those shells are generally stronger in ladies from developing countries ..harder to break with all the talents & potential bried deep inside.

Now when I am asked to come of out my shell,I need to break open this dearly held shell ;which tirelessly worked for me so far.Hold on,these shells also worked like filters ,that filter out men & women before they could ever touch your core.

Ok, I am ready to break it and enter the world with open arm,heart & mind..then is that only sunshine come inside? Anybody out there with no shells & filters ??
Not sure ..Let the world move in that direction where ladies can afford to have softer shells..
